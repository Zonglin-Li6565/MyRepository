The goal of this project is to create a way letting people easily createcomplicated neural network without writing a single line of code or with minimalcoding. \parBasically, the output of this project will be a C++ program(called targetprogram) consists of a neural network, a trainning function, and a predictingfunction. The target program will be based on multilayer feedforward neuralnetwork, and LSTM recurrent neural network, be able to be trained if fed withdata, to make prediction, and to cooperate with other neural network (byexposing the value of inner nodes).
