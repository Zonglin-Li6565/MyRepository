As other Asian immigrants to America, Korean Americans are
experiencing difficulties in assimilation to the main stream culture.
There are barriers like language, ways of thinking and the not acceptance of
their degree from their home country. Because of those difficulties, more
Koreans preferred to be self-employed than national
average \cite{online:SelfEmployed}. Since self-employment doesn't require a
fixed working time, and the businesses are generally family owned, this can impact
children caring in mostly two ways: the time spend with children and have
children help their parents' businesses. In this project, I will exam those
two impacts by reading a book and make an interview with a Korean American
family.
